# variable scope = where a variable is visible and accessible 
# scope resolution = (LEGB) : Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built-in

# Local: Variables defined inside the current function.
# Enclosing: Variables in the enclosing (outer) function.
# Global: Variables at the top level of the module.
# Built-in: Pythonâ€™s built-in names.
