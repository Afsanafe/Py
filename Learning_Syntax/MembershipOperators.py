# Membership Operators = used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence 
#                                           (string, list, tuple, set, or dictionary) - included but not limited to
#                                           1. in
#                                           2. not 
# There are two membership operators in Python:
# in â†’ returns True if the value is found.
# not in â†’ returns True if the value is not found.
